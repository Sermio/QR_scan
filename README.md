<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This app allows users to scan QR codes quickly and efficiently. By using the camera on a mobile device, the app can detect and interpret QR codes, providing users with the possibility to send encoded data from the QR code to a backend. The app features an intuitive interface, with easy-to-use functionality for both beginners and advanced users. It also ensures security and privacy by not storing or sharing scanned information without user consent.
